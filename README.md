# Résumé

This is the source code for my resume.

## Requirements

All these commands should be found in your `$PATH`.  Don't know where
to get them?  That's the fun part, it's like a scavenger hunt.

- `make`
- `jsonnet`
- `python`
- `wkhtmltopdf`

## Usage

Just run `make` to make the résumé pop out.
